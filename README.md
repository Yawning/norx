### NORX - A Parallel and Scalable Authenticated Encryption Algorithm
#### Yawning Angel (yawning at schwanenlied dot me)

## Warning
NORX is a rather new authenticated encryption algorithm. The authors are
confident that it is secure but nevertheless NORX should be considered
**experimental**. Therefore, **do not use** it in your applications!

This package implements the NORX Authenticated Encryption Algorithm,
specifically the NORX64-4-1 and NORX64-6-1 variants, as recommended by the
designers for software implementations on modern 64-bit CPUs.

This implementation is derived from the Public Domain reference implementation
by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Philipp Jovanovic, and Samuel Neves.
